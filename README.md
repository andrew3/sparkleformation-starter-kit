# SparkleFormation Starter Kit

This repo is provided as a starting point for experimentation and development of CloudFormation templates using [SparkleFormation](https://github.com/sparkleformation/sparkle_formation/) and [knife-cloudformation](https://github.com/hw-labs/knife-cloudformation). For an introduction see our article from the 2014 AWS Advent series, [Build infrastructure with CloudFormation without losing your sanity](AWS_ADVENT.md).
